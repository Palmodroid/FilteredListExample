FilteredListExample
===================

FilteredListExample is a simple-sample list. 
It shows a ListFragment helped by a custom BaseAdapter.
Sample items can be added, and all items can be cleared from menu. 
Items are not saved between sessions. 
Long and short taps are implemented.
Options menus are available form Activity and also form Fragment.

Filtering added (long-lasting process simulated!) 
Newly added elements will be shown only in case of true filtering condition.
Soft-keyboard hides on list-view tap.

Loader added, external data load simulated.
Data refresh (through broadcast messages) and Loader restart can be used.
Adapter and filtering changed to work with Loader.
Different progress indicators added. Progress communicated by broadcast-messages.
